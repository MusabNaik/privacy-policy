    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Effective Date: May 24, 2024</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Encrypted Drive (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our App. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the App.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Google User Data</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Google OAuth:</b> When you authenticate using Google OAuth, we collect and use your Google account information to allow access to your Google Drive. This includes only the information necessary to create and access the "Encrypted-Drive" folder in your Google Drive.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Access to Google Drive:</b> We only access and manage files within the "Encrypted-Drive" folder that the App creates in your Google Drive. We do not access any other files or folders in your Google Drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Encryption and Decryption:</b> All encryption and decryption processes occur locally on your machine. The unencrypted data and password never leave your device.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>No Storage of User Information:</b> We do not store any user information on our servers.
    </p>
      <b>Limited Use Disclosure:</b> Encrypted Driveâ€™s use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      <b>No Sharing:</b> We do not share your information with any third parties. The App operates locally on your device and does not transmit any data to external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.
    </p>
